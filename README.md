# Loan Approval Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting loan approval status based on various features such as income, education, loan amount, no of dependants and more.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not. This prediction can help financial institutions streamline their loan approval processes and minimize risks.

### Features
- **Model Training:** Utilizes a variety of machine learning algorithms to determine the best fit for the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering:** Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Model Evaluation:** Measures performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Data Information
The dataset used for this project contains information on applicants such as:
- **No of dependents**
- **Education**
- **Applicant Income**
- **self employability**
- **Loan Amount**
- **Loan Amount Term**
- **cibil score**
- **Assets**
- **Loan Status**

### Data Source
The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed [here](#).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For data analysis and model development

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-approval-ml.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd loan-approval-ml
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application in the `/webapp` directory.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess data and train the model:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Evaluate the model and save the trained model for deployment.
